# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation analysis using unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) on the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset. The goal is to group customers into different segments based on their shopping behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following features:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1â€“100)

## Objective

To segment customers into distinct groups so that businesses can:
- Better understand customer behavior
- Personalize marketing strategies
- Improve customer satisfaction and retention

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Steps Performed

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. Visualization:
   - Distribution plots for Age, Income, and Spending Score
   - Pairplots and correlation heatmaps

3. Feature Selection:
   - Selected relevant features (Annual Income, Spending Score)

4. Clustering:
   - Used the K-Means Algorithm
   - Applied
## Future Improvements

- Use advanced clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Deploy the model as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
